2d-human-pose-estimation,2D Human Pose Estimation,"What is Human Pose Estimation?
Human pose estimation is the process of estimating the configuration of the body (pose) from a single, typically monocular, image. Background. Human pose estimation is one of the key problems in computer vision that has been studied for well over 15 years.  The reason for its importance is the
abundance of applications that can benefit from such a technology. For example,
human pose estimation allows for higher-level reasoning in the context of human-computer interaction and activity recognition; it is also one of the basic building blocks for marker-less motion capture (MoCap) technology. MoCap technology is useful for applications ranging from character animation to clinical analysis of gait pathologies."

The optimal assignment houses all the items with the fewest bins such that the total weight of items in a bin is below the bin’s capacity. In its 3D version (3D-BPP), an item has a 3D “weight” corresponding
to its length, width and height."

aspect-based-sentiment-analysis,Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA),"**Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)** is a Natural Language Processing task that aims to identify and extract the sentiment of specific aspects or components of a product or service. ABSA typically involves a multi-step process that begins with identifying the aspects or features of the product or service that are being discussed in the text. This is followed by sentiment analysis, where the sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) is assigned to each aspect based on the context of the sentence or document. Finally, the results are aggregated to provide an overall sentiment for each aspect.

And recent works propose more challenging ABSA tasks to predict sentiment triplets or quadruplets (Chen et al., 2022), the most influential of which are ASTE (Peng et al., 2020; Zhai et al., 2022), TASD (Wan et al., 2020), ASQP (Zhang et al., 2021a) and ACOS with an emphasis on the implicit aspects or opinions (Cai et al., 2020a).

The posterior then informs where to make the next observation of the target function through the use of an acquisition function, which balances the exploitation of regions known to have good performance with the exploration of regions where there is little information about the function’s response.

Cells are treated with one of 113 small molecules at 8 concentrations, and fluorescent images are captured staining for nucleus, actin and microtubules. The phenotypic profiling problem is presented, where the goal is to extract features containing meaningful information about the cellular phenotype exhibited. Each of 103 unique compound concentration treatment is labeled with a mechanism-of-action (MOA). The MOA is predicted for each unique treatment (averaging features over all treatment examples) by matching the MOA of the closest point excluding points of the same compound.

combinatorial-optimization,Combinatorial Optimization,"**Combinatorial Optimization** is a category of problems which requires optimizing a function over a combination of discrete objects and the solutions are constrained. Examples include finding shortest paths in a graph, maximizing value in the Knapsack problem and finding boolean settings that satisfy a set of constraints. Many of these problems are NP-Hard, which means that no polynomial time solution can be developed for them. Instead, we can only produce approximations in polynomial time that are guaranteed to be some factor worse than the true optimal solution.

cross-modal-information-retrieval,Cross-Modal Information Retrieval,"**Cross-Modal Information Retrieval** (CMIR) is the task of finding relevant items across different modalities. For example, given an image, find a text or vice versa. The main challenge in CMIR is known as the *heterogeneity gap*: since items from different modalities have different data types, the similarity between them cannot be measured directly. Therefore, the majority of CMIR methods published to date attempt to bridge this gap by learning a latent representation space, where the similarity between items from different modalities can be measured.

Thus, it is very promising to formulate a category-agnostic DIS task for accurately segmenting objects with different structure complexities, regardless of their characteristics. Compared with semantic segmentation, the proposed DIS task usually focuses on images with single or a few targets, from which getting richer accurate details of each target is more feasible."

The goal is to approximately recover the dictionary $A$.

It is attached to many operations and has many applications for analysis and visualization. Diffeomorphic mapping can be used to relate various sources of information which are indexed as a function of spatial position as the key index variable. Diffeomorphisms are by their Latin root structure preserving transformations, which are in turn differentiable and therefore smooth, allowing for the calculation of metric based quantities such as arc length and surface areas. Spatial location and extents in human anatomical coordinate systems can be recorded via a variety of Medical imaging modalities, generally termed multi-modal medical imagery, providing either scalar and or vector quantities at each spatial location.

document-shadow-removal,Document Shadow Removal,"Document shadow removal refers to the process of eliminating or reducing the appearance of shadows in scanned or photographed documents. Shadows can occur due to various factors, such as uneven lighting, folds in the paper, or the presence of objects casting shadows during the scanning or capturing process.

Removing shadows from documents is important because they can degrade the readability and quality of the content. Shadows can obscure text or graphics, making it difficult to extract accurate information from the document. By eliminating shadows, the document becomes more legible and suitable for various purposes, including optical character recognition (OCR), document analysis, and archival purposes.

Document shadow removal techniques typically involve image processing and enhancement algorithms. These algorithms analyze the image and identify regions that contain shadows. They then adjust the brightness, contrast, and other image properties in the shadowed areas to minimize or eliminate the shadow effect. This process often requires advanced image analysis and manipulation techniques, such as histogram equalization, adaptive filtering, and image segmentation.

In recent years, machine learning and deep learning approaches have also been applied to document shadow removal. These methods utilize large datasets of shadowed and non-shadowed documents to train models that can automatically detect and remove shadows from new images. The models learn to recognize the characteristics of shadows and generate shadow-free versions of the documents.

Overall, document shadow removal plays a crucial role in improving the quality and legibility of scanned or photographed documents, making them more suitable for various applications in areas such as digital archiving, document analysis, and information extraction."

Moreover, DRSs can be translated to formal logic, which allows for automatic forms of inference by third parties.

Brain waves originate from the postsynaptic potential of the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells. The formation of synchronous rhythm of EEG is also related to the activity of nonspecific projection system of cortex and thalamus. EEG is the basic theoretical research of brain science.

This way the aim of XAI is to explain what has been done, what is done right now, what will be done next and unveil the information the actions are based on.

For directed graphs, a feedback vertex set is instead a subset of vertices whose removal results in directed acyclic graph (DAG), not necessarily a forest. This task can refer to either looking for a set of provably minimal size (in as little time as possible), or a heuristic algorithm that produces small solutions quickly (but which may have even smaller sets)."

Theoretically, the Graph Matching problem can be solved by exhaustively searching the entire solution space. However, this approach is infeasible in practice because the solution space expands exponentially as the size of input data increases. For that reason, previous studies have attempted to solve the problem by using various approximation techniques.

Image segmentation generates a binary image, in which a pixel either belongs to foreground or background. However, Image Matting is different from the image segmentation, wherein some pixels may belong to foreground as well as background, such pixels are called partial or mixed pixels. In order to fully separate the foreground from the background in an image, accurate estimation of the alpha values for partial or mixed pixels is necessary.

Usually, demonstrations are presented in the form of state-action trajectories, with each pair indicating the action to take at the state being visited. In order to learn the behavior policy, the demonstrated actions are usually utilized in two ways. The first, known as Behavior Cloning (BC), treats the action as the target label for each state, and then learns a generalized mapping from states to actions in a supervised manner. Another way, known as Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), views the demonstrated actions as a sequence of decisions, and aims at finding a reward/cost function under which the demonstrated decisions are optimal. 

Finally, a newer methodology, Inverse Q-Learning aims at directly learning Q-functions from expert data, implicitly representing rewards, under which the optimal policy can be given as a Boltzmann distribution similar to soft Q-learning

If the visual query is an image of a shoe, visual Instance Search does not try to find images of shoes, which might differ from the query in shape, color or size, but tries to find images of the exact same shoe as the one in the query image. Visual Instance Search challenges image representations as the features extracted from the images must enable such fine-grained recognition despite variations in viewpoints, scale, position, illumination, etc. Whereas holistic image representations, where each image is mapped to a single high-dimensional vector, are sufficient for coarse-grained similarity retrieval, local features are needed for instance retrieval.

Reflectance is the color of the object, invariant to camera viewpoint and illumination conditions, whereas shading, dependent on camera viewpoint and object geometry, consists of different illumination effects, such as shadows, shading and inter-reflections. Using intrinsic images, instead of the original images, can be beneficial for many computer vision algorithms. For instance, for shape-from-shading algorithms, the shading images contain important visual cues to recover geometry, while for segmentation and detection algorithms, reflectance images can be beneficial as they are independent of confounding illumination effects. Furthermore, intrinsic images are used in a wide range of computational photography applications, such as material recoloring, relighting, retexturing and stylization.

Deep Lipreading is the process of extracting speech from a video of a silent talking face using deep neural networks.  It is also known by few other names: Visual Speech Recognition (VSR), Machine Lipreading, Automatic Lipreading etc. 

The primary methodology involves two stages: i) Extracting visual and temporal features from a sequence of image frames from a silent talking video ii) Processing the sequence of features into units of speech e.g. characters, words, phrases etc. We can find several implementations of this methodology either done in two separate stages or trained end-to-end in one go."

Question: What exactly is the medical code prediction problem?

Answer: Clinical notes contain much information about what precisely happened during the patient's entire stay. And those clinical notes (e.g., discharge summary) is typically long, loosely structured, consists of medical domain language, and sometimes riddled with spelling errors. So, it's a highly multi-label classification problem, and the forthcoming ICD-11 standard will add more complexity to the problem! The medical code prediction problem is to annotate this clinical note with multiple codes subset from nearly 70K total codes (in the current ICD-10 system, for example)."

Medical Image Registration is used in many clinical applications such as image guidance, motion tracking, segmentation, dose accumulation, image reconstruction and so on. Medical Image Registration is a broad topic which can be grouped from various perspectives. From input image point of view, registration methods can be divided into unimodal, multimodal, interpatient, intra-patient (e.g. same- or different-day) registration. From deformation model point of view, registration methods can be divided in to rigid, affine and deformable methods. From region of interest (ROI) perspective, registration methods can be grouped according to anatomical sites such as brain, lung registration and so on.

Deep neural network and transformer based architecture are currently the most popular methods for this certain task, however, when we try to transfer out pre-trained model into this certain domain, their performance always degrade. 



The following are some of the reasons why RSG is hard for pre-trained models:

* Language datasets in a particular domain can sometimes be quite different from the large number of datasets available on the Internet
* During the fine-tuning phase, datasets in the medical field are often unevenly distributed



More recently, multi-modal learning and contrastive learning have shown some inspiring results in this field, but it's still challenging and requires further attention.

Various loss functions have been developed for Metric Learning. For example, the **contrastive loss** guides the objects from the same class to be mapped to the same point and those from different classes to be mapped to different points whose distances are larger than a margin. **Triplet loss** is also popular, which requires the distance between the anchor sample and the positive sample to be smaller than the distance between the anchor sample and the negative sample.

There are different approaches to motion magnification, such as Lagrangian and Eulerian methods. Lagrangian methods track the trajectories of moving objects and exaggerate them, while Eulerian methods manipulate the motions at fixed positions. Eulerian methods can be further divided into linear and phase-based methods. Linear methods apply a temporal bandpass filter to boost the linear term of a Taylor series expansion of the displacement function, while phase-based methods use complex wavelet transforms to manipulate the phase of the signal.

In traditional text prediction, the prediction is based solely on the context of the sentence, such as the words that precede the target word. In multimodal text prediction, additional modalities, such as images, audio, or user behavior, are also used to inform the prediction.

For example, in a multimodal text prediction system for captioning images, the system may use both the content of the image and the words that have been typed so far to generate the next word in the caption. The image may provide additional context or information about the content of the caption, while the typed words may provide information about the style or tone of the caption.

Multimodal text prediction can be achieved using a variety of techniques, including deep learning models and statistical models. These models can be trained on large datasets of text and multimodal inputs to learn the relationships between the different types of data and improve the accuracy of the predictions.

Multimodal text prediction has many applications, including chatbots, virtual assistants, and predictive text input for mobile devices.

In a k-way MCQA task, a model is provided with a question q, a set of candidate options O = {O1, . . . , Ok}, and a supporting context for each option C = {C1, . . . , Ck}. The model needs to predict the correct answer option that is best supported by the given contexts."

It is assumed that individual labels $y_1, y_2,\ldots, y_M$ exist for the instances within a bag, but they are unknown during training. In the standard Multiple Instance assumption, a bag is considered negative if all its instances are negative. On the other hand, a bag is positive, if at least one instance in the bag is positive.

natural-image-orientation-angle-detection,Natural Image Orientation Angle Detection,"Image orientation angle detection is a pretty challenging task for a machine because the machine has to learn the features of an image in such a way so that it can detect the arbitrary angle by which the image is rotated. Though there are some modern cameras with features involving inertial sensors that can correct image orientation in steps of 90 degrees, those features are seldom used. In this paper, we propose a method to detect the orientation angle of a digitally captured image where the image may have been captured by a camera at a tilted angle (between 0\degree to 359\degree)."

| Premise | Label | Hypothesis |
| --- | ---| --- |
| A man inspects the uniform of a figure in some East Asian country. | contradiction | The man is sleeping. |
| An older and younger man smiling. | neutral  | Two men are smiling and laughing at the cats playing on the floor. |
| A soccer game with multiple males playing. | entailment | Some men are playing a sport. |

Approaches used for NLI include earlier symbolic and statistical approaches to more recent deep learning approaches. Benchmark datasets used for NLI include [SNLI](/dataset/snli), [MultiNLI](/dataset/multinli), [SciTail](/dataset/scitail), among others. You can get hands-on practice on the SNLI task by following this [d2l.ai chapter](https://d2l.ai/chapter_natural-language-processing-applications/natural-language-inference-and-dataset.html).

This interface can be used as a bridge connecting RL libraries with physics simulation and tasks running in the Isaac Sim framework."

Since $1-N$ includes the case of $1-1$, we only discusses PRC in $1-N$ conversations. The task of PRC in $1-N$ conversations can be formulated as:

$Per_i = argmax_{Per'_i}P(Per'_i | C_{i,j}, \cdots, C_{i,N})$

pico,PICO,"The proliferation of healthcare data has contributed to the widespread usage of the PICO paradigm for creating specific clinical questions from RCT. 

PICO is a mnemonic that stands for:

Population/Problem: Addresses the characteristics of populations involved and the specific characteristics of the disease or disorder.
Intervention: Addresses the primary intervention (including treatments, procedures, or diagnostic tests) along with any risk factors.
Comparison: Compares the efficacy of any new interventions with the primary intervention.
Outcome: Measures the results of the intervention, including improvements or side effects.
PICO is an essential tool that aids evidence-based practitioners in creating precise clinical questions and searchable keywords to address those issues. It calls for a high level of technical competence and medical domain knowledge, but it’s also frequently very time-consuming.

Automatically identifying PICO elements from this large sea of data can be made easier with the aid of machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP). This facilitates the development of precise research questions by evidence-based practitioners more quickly and precisely.

Empirical studies have shown that the use of PICO frames improves the specificity and conceptual clarity of clinical problems, elicits more information during pre-search reference interviews, leads to more complex search strategies, and yields more precise search results."

A large and dense collection of points in three-dimensional space, collected by sensors such as LiDAR, is known as a point cloud. Points in the point cloud consist of geometric properties, such as three-dimensional spatial coordinates (x, y, z), and other attributes like color, reflectance, opacity, etc., represented by feature vectors. Since point clouds can directly represent the 3D world, they are widely employed in various fields, such as photogrammetry, power monitoring, architectural surveying, digital manufacturing, autonomous driving, gaming, cultural heritage 
 reservation, and more. 
### Significance
Interactive point clouds typically contain millions of colored points and may possess complex attributes. To address the substantial transmission bandwidth and storage space required by point clouds, 
 esearchers have developed various point cloud compression (PCC) techniques. However, point cloud compression may introduce significant visual distortions. In addition, deformations and distortions frequently occur during the acquisition, processing, transmission, rendering, and interaction of point clouds, all of which degrade the visual quality of the point cloud, ultimately impacting the application’s user experience. Therefore, effective methods
for quantifying the quality of compressed point clouds are needed. More generally, point cloud quality assessment (PCQA) is crucial for optimizing and evaluating point cloud processing algorithms, such as encoding, denoising, and super-resolution."

Given several sets of points in different coordinate systems, the aim of registration is to find the transformation that best aligns all of them into a common coordinate system. Point Cloud Registration plays a significant role in many vision applications such as 3D model reconstruction, cultural heritage management, landslide monitoring and solar energy analysis.

For example, given a sentence “Barack Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii.”, a relation classifier aims at predicting the relation of “bornInCity”. Relation Extraction is the key component for building relation knowledge graphs, and it is of crucial significance to natural language processing applications such as structured search, sentiment analysis, question answering, and summarization.

representation-learning,Representation Learning,"**Representation Learning**  is a process in machine learning where algorithms extract meaningful patterns from raw data to create representations that are easier to understand and process. These representations can be designed for interpretability, reveal hidden features, or be used for transfer learning. They are valuable across many fundamental machine learning tasks like [image classification](/task/image-classification) and [retrieval](/task/image-retrieval).

Deep neural networks can be considered representation learning models that typically encode information which is projected into a different subspace. These representations are then usually passed on to a linear classifier to, for instance, train a classifier. 

Representation learning can be divided into:

-  **Supervised representation learning**: learning representations on task A using annotated data and used to solve task B
- **Unsupervised representation learning**: learning representations on a task in an unsupervised way (label-free data). These are then used to address downstream tasks and reducing the need for annotated data when learning news tasks. Powerful models like [GPT](/method/gpt) and [BERT](/method/bert) leverage unsupervised representation learning to tackle language tasks.  

More recently, [self-supervised learning (SSL)](/task/self-supervised-learning) is one of the main drivers behind unsupervised representation learning in fields like computer vision and NLP.

Visual tracking is one such solution, but concerns arise around the potential leakage of raw video information and many people are not comfortable accepting cameras in their homes or workplaces. We propose a human tracking and identification system (mID) based on millimeter wave radar which has a high tracking accuracy, without being visually compromising. Unlike competing techniques based on WiFi Channel State Information (CSI), it is capable of tracking and identifying multiple people simultaneously. Using a lowcost, commercial, off-the-shelf radar, we first obtain sparse point clouds and form temporally associated trajectories.""

A more popular recent example is a contrastive loss, which measure the similarity of sample pairs in a representation space, and where there can be a varying target instead of a fixed target to reconstruct (as in the case of autoencoders).

A common evaluation protocol is to train a linear classifier on top of (frozen) representations learnt by self-supervised methods. The leaderboards for the linear evaluation protocol can be found below. In practice, it is more common to fine-tune features on a downstream task. An alternative evaluation protocol therefore uses semi-supervised learning and finetunes on a % of the labels. The leaderboards for the finetuning protocol can be accessed [here](https://paperswithcode.com/task/semi-supervised-image-classification).

Producing a dataset with good labels is expensive, while unlabeled data is being generated all the time. The motivation of Self-Supervised Learning is to make use of the large amount of unlabeled data. The main idea of Self-Supervised Learning is to generate the labels from unlabeled data, according to the structure or characteristics of the data itself, and then train on this unsupervised data in a supervised manner. Self-Supervised Learning is wildly used in representation learning to make a model learn the latent features of the data.

semantic-segmentation,Semantic Segmentation,"**Semantic Segmentation** is a computer vision task in which the goal is to categorize each pixel in an image into a class or object. The goal is to produce a dense pixel-wise segmentation map of an image, where each pixel is assigned to a specific class or object. Some example benchmarks for this task are Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC and ADE20K. Models are usually evaluated with the Mean Intersection-Over-Union (Mean IoU) and Pixel Accuracy metrics.

This means that the standard practice in semi-supervised learning of using a random class stratified sample is ""cheating"" in this case, as class information is required for the whole dataset for this to be done. Rather, this challenge requires a smart cold-start or unsupervised selective labelling strategy to identify images that are most informative and result in the best performing models."

For instance, a text-based tweet can be categorized into either ""positive"", ""negative"", or ""neutral"". Given the text and accompanying labels, a model can be trained to predict the correct sentiment. 

**Sentiment Analysis** techniques can be categorized into machine learning approaches, lexicon-based approaches, and even hybrid methods. Some subcategories of research in sentiment analysis include: multimodal sentiment analysis, aspect-based sentiment analysis, fine-grained opinion analysis, language specific sentiment analysis.

More recently, deep learning techniques, such as RoBERTa and T5, are used to train high-performing sentiment classifiers that are evaluated using metrics like F1, recall, and precision. To evaluate sentiment analysis systems, benchmark datasets like SST, GLUE, and IMDB movie reviews are used.

temporal-relation-classification,Temporal Relation Classification,"Temporal Relation Classification is the task that is concerned with classifying the temporal relation between a pair of temporal entities (traditional events and temporal expressions). Initial approaches aimed to classify the temporal relation in thirteen relation types that were depicted by James Allen in his seminal work ""Maintaining Knowledge about Temporal Intervals"". However, due to the ambiguity in the annotation, recent corpora have been limiting the type of relations to a subset of those relations.

Notice that although Temporal Relation Classification can be thought of as a subtask of Temporal Relation Extraction, the two tasks can be morphed if one adds a label that indicates the absence of a temporal relation between the entities (e.g. ""no_relation"" or ""vague"") to Temporal Relation Classification."
temporal-relation-extraction,Temporal Relation Extraction,"Temporal relation extraction systems aim to identify and classify the temporal relation between a pair of entities provided in a text.

topic-coverage,Topic coverage,"A prevalent use case of topic models is that of topic discovery.
However, most of the topic model evaluation methods rely on abstract metrics such as perplexity or topic coherence. The topic coverage approach is to measure the models' performance by matching model-generated topics to a fixed set of reference topics - topics discovered by humans and represented in a machine-readable format. This way, the models are evaluated in the context of their use, by essentially simulating topic modeling in a fixed setting defined by a text collection and a set of reference topics.
Reference topics represent a ground truth that can be used to evaluate both topic models and other measures of model performance. This coverage approach enables large-scale automatic evaluation of existing and future topic models."

transliteration,Transliteration,"**Transliteration** is a mechanism for converting a word in a source (foreign) language to a target language, and often adopts approaches from machine translation. In machine translation, the objective is to preserve the semantic meaning of the utterance as much as possible while following the syntactic structure in the target language. In Transliteration, the objective is to preserve the original pronunciation of the source word as much as possible while following the phonological structures of the target language.

For example, the city’s name “Manchester” has become well known by people of languages other than English. These new words are often named entities that are important in cross-lingual information retrieval, information extraction, machine translation, and often present out-of-vocabulary challenges to spoken language technologies such as automatic speech recognition, spoken keyword search, and text-to-speech.

ucca-parsing,UCCA Parsing,"UCCA (Abend and Rappoport, 2013) is a semantic representation whose main design principles are ease of annotation, cross-linguistic applicability, and a modular architecture. UCCA represents the semantics of linguistic utterances as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where terminal (childless) nodes correspond to the text tokens, and non-terminal nodes to semantic units that participate in some super-ordinate relation. Edges are labeled, indicating the role of a child in the relation the parent represents. UCCA’s foundational layer mostly covers predicate-argument structure, semantic heads and inter-Scene relations. UCCA distinguishes primary edges, corresponding to explicit relations, from remote edges that allow for a unit to participate in several super-ordinate relations. Primary edges form a tree in each layer, whereas remote edges enable reentrancy, forming a DAG.

unet-segmentation,UNET Segmentation,"U-Net is an architecture for semantic segmentation. It consists of a contracting path (Up to down) and an expanding path (Down to up). During the contraction, the spatial information is reduced while feature information is increased.
The contracting path follows the typical architecture of a convolutional network. It consists of the repeated application of two 3x3 convolutions (unpadded convolutions), each followed by a rectified linear unit (ReLU) and a 2x2 max pooling operation with stride 2 for downsampling. At each downsampling step, we double the number of feature channels. Every step in the expansive path consists of an upsampling of the feature map followed by a 2x2 convolution (“up-convolution”) that halves the number of feature channels, a concatenation with the correspondingly cropped feature map from the contracting path, and two 3x3 convolutions, each followed by a ReLU. The cropping is necessary due to the loss of border pixels in every convolution. At the final layer, a 1x1 convolution is used to map each 64-component feature vector to the desired number of classes. In total the network has 23 convolutional layers."

unsupervised-anomaly-detection,Unsupervised Anomaly Detection,"The objective of **Unsupervised Anomaly Detection** is to detect previously unseen rare objects or events without any prior knowledge about these. The only information available is that the percentage of anomalies in the dataset is small, usually less than 1%. Since anomalies are rare and unknown to the user at training time, anomaly detection in most cases boils down to the problem of modelling the normal data distribution and defining a measurement in this space in order to classify samples as anomalous or normal. In high-dimensional data such as images, distances in the original space quickly lose descriptive power (curse of dimensionality) and a mapping to some more suitable space is required.

A conclusion is considered to be valid if it is supported by inferences that link the premise to the conclusion, based on logical principles or commonsense or world knowledge, which may be defeasible. A conclusion will be trivially considered valid if it repeats or summarizes the premise – in which case it can hardly be considered as novel.

The granularity of the labels that are needed to describe the frames and the video depends on the task. Typical tasks include assigning one or more global labels to the video, and assigning one or more labels for each frame inside the video.

Firstly, we create UIT-ViSFD, a Vietnamese Smartphone Feedback Dataset as a new benchmark corpus built based on strict annotation schemes for evaluating aspect-based sentiment analysis, consisting of 11,122 human-annotated comments for mobile e-commerce, which is freely available for research purposes. We also present a proposed approach based on the Bi-LSTM architecture with the fastText word embeddings for the Vietnamese aspect-based sentiment task. Our experiments show that our approach achieves the best performances with the F1-score of 84.48% for the aspect task and 63.06% for the sentiment task, which performs several conventional machine learning and deep learning systems. Last but not least, we build SA2SL, a social listening system based on the best performance model on our dataset, which will inspire more social listening systems in the future.

However, such assumption can be impractical when the semantic context is unknown and evolving.

For example, given the word “mouse” and the following sentence:

“A mouse consists of an object held in one's hand, with one or more buttons.” 

we would assign “mouse”  with its electronic device sense ([the 4th sense in the WordNet sense inventory](http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?c=8&sub=Change&o2=&o0=1&o8=1&o1=1&o7=&o5=&o9=&o6=&o3=&o4=&i=-1&h=000000&s=mouse))."

We do not need to know the sense/meaning of each cluster, but sentences inside a cluster should have used the target words with the same sense.

The main challenge in the task is known as the *heterogeneity gap*: since items from different modalities have different data types, the similarity between them cannot be measured directly. Therefore, the majority of methods published to date attempt to bridge this gap by learning a latent representation space, where the similarity between items from different modalities can be measured.

In the computer vision context, more recent advances learn mappings from image feature space to semantic space. Other approaches learn non-linear multimodal embeddings. In the modern NLP context, language models can be evaluated on downstream tasks without fine tuning.
